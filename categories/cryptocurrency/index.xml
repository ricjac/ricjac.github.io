      <description>Intro In PART 1 we looked at setting up a Bitcoin full node connected to TestNet3. We should now take some steps to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s secure.
Begin by SSH-ing to the server - as root:
# where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address or host name of the server ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  Setup a firewall - Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) Let&amp;rsquo;s first lock down all incoming ports except those we want to receive, being:</description>
